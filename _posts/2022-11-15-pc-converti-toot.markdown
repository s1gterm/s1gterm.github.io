We all want to be able to run the latest and greatest applications on our devices. Device lifespan is important to minimize e-waste.  But oftentimes, developers have to make tough choices.  There are devices with too small of a community of users, or that lack the functionality of the latest and greatest on the market.  These make for tough choices.    

And then there is the IBM PC Convertible.

While it is technically old enough to run for president in the US, it comes feature packed with dual 3.5" floppy disks, a proprietary I/O output format, and a 640 x 200 pixel screen.

Somehow, there is just no Mastodon client available for the IBM PC Convertible.  I want to cure that oversight.  Now, we have a few things going against us here.  This machine hasn't been turned on in over a decade.  Surprisingly, there is no support for ethernet or wifi. It lacks a hard drive, and utilizes a stack of 3.5" floppy discs.  

To get started, I've split this up into some decent chunks of work.  Check back as I get these updated or follow me on Mastodon at [@s1gterm@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@s1gterm){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}
